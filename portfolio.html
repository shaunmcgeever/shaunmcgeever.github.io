		The Delta is an application that helps programmers learn a second programming language. It is a visual tool that displays the differences and changes in syntax but similar theory between different languages. It uses an in-browser text editor that "records" the user's input and allows the user to play back what they have typed. It plays back at the same speed at which they typed it in, so it has a real, personal feel to it. As team lead, I organized the team’s ideas for new features, as well as updating the team’s overall status while budgeting time and resources.

		SoundCrowd is a work in progress; it is an MVP of something much bigger. Currently, a user can query SoundCloud and add songs to their created playlists, using the SoundCloud API. Users can view other users playlists, but they can only update their own. The main idea is to allow the user to query multiple music sites, so that a playlist can be made from multiple sources. Thus, the user wouldn't have to change between tabs of their browser to stream their music (e.g. YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, Hypem, etc). The next step in development is to incorporate more APIs, and work on overall user experience and aesthetics.
