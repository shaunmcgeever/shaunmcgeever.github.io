<p><span>So it’s the end of Week 7 and I have not been able to keep up with this blog. I can’t say it’s a bad thing though; it means I’ve been busy with the work DBC has given me.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So the last time I checked in here it was the second day of Week 6. So I’ll give a quick recap of how Week 6 finished up. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span><strong>Day 3:  </strong>We were given an “Advanced” active record challenge to do in the AM, which went over many of the topics we discussed in the previous day’s lecture. Our instructor set it up so that we would have everything available in one file, including the database, so that we didn’t have to run db:drop,create,migrate,seed. This was really convenient and we didn’t have to waste any time setting up the environment every time. The challenge was to determine and model the relationships between Hotels, Rooms, Users, and Bookings. This is what the final migrations, models, and relationships look like using some of the more “advanced” techniques:</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/4da6512dbee44dcb415296ad882854e1/tumblr_inline_n5t0ok6T4F1swddm8.png"/></p>

<p><br/><span></span><br/><span><strong>Day 4: </strong>We had our Phase 2 assessment. Unlike last week, where there were four separate, independent problems, we were given one problem that included everything we had studied up to that point. The assignment was to make a Sinatra application for an event management system. We were given roughly 3 hours to complete it. It was broken into the following parts:</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>-Part 1: Authentication</span><br/><span>     Our app needed to include user authentication. We needed to let the user sign up, and then let them have the ability to sign in and out whenever they choose. During sign up, we needed to include validations on their email, specifically ones that guarantees uniqueness, proper format, and presence (every user must enter an email). Every user must also have a password. This password would be used to authenticate the user whenever they chose to sign in. However, this password could not be stored in the database. This was a great time to use the bcrypt gem. With the bcrypt gem, I was able to encrypt the users password into a hash value, making it essentially unreadable. Without knowing how bcrypt formulated this encryption, the users password would be safely, and securely, stored in my database. During user login, I could use bcrypt to translate the password entered by the user, and check if the entered password’s encryption matched the encrypted password in the database. It’s a quite mouthful to say, but it’s a really cool and useful gem.  </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>-Part 2: Events</span><br/><span>     We needed to include the proper associations for all of our models. Specifically users and events. Users can attend many events and an event can be attended by many users. Events are user created too, so an event belongs to a user, and a user can create multiple events. We could represent these associations using: </span><br/><span>     -user.created_events</span><br/><span>     and</span><br/><span>     -user.attended_events</span><br/><span></span><br/><span> So those relations ended up looking like this (I included the bcrypt code as well; why not?): </span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/43950d519970f8951ad0f84e528a25f4/tumblr_inline_n5t0rk4ooi1swddm8.png"/></p>

<p><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><span>-Part 3: CRUD</span><br/><span>     The main focus of this part was to establish the main CRUD features to the events. A user should be able to create an event, show all of their created events, edit their own events, and destroy the events they have created. Pretty straight forward stuff, but I think I spent a little too much time on it making it just right (making all the pages look clean, proper line breaks, a little css, etc). Which kinda came back to bite me when I had to do:</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>-Part 4: AJAX!</span><br/><span>     When a user wanted to enter a new event, a new page would be brought up. So instead of rendering a new page with a form every time, I included the form on the users events index page. That way, the user could just add events and they would append themselves to the end of the users list in front of them. I was able to set up the form and the javascript file, but I didn’t get a chance to actually write out the code to make it append to the current list. I was able to prevent the default action of the form, parse/interpret the data using JSON, but I ran out of time before I could add the event on the server side. Another half hour and I know I would have had it done. But overall, I was happy with my performance and assessment. I understood and followed the entire assignment, I just misjudged my time a bit. In this situation, I think that’s a lesser of my worries, and is one of the things that can be easily worked on.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Overall it was a good day and I am excited to move onto Phase 3.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span><strong>Day 5 + Weekend:</strong></span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So on Friday, they gave us the day to create any kind of app we wanted. We could create anything we want, and we would present them to the class later that day (around 5&#160;pm). I worked with Phil on a cool idea he had. We wanted to make an app that would help programmers that know one programming language learn another language. For example, I could say my preferred language is Ruby, but I’d like to know how to write methods and loops in Javascript. The idea was to make a visual representation of how the code can start in the preferred language, and then transformed into the desired language. We called it Delta. We weren’t devising a formula that dynamically changed the code into the new language. We got that question a lot. Instead, we wanted to take a static picture of the original code and the final desired code, and then have a GIF image in the middle which displayed the incremental changes. We made it so users can post their own questions, specifying which languages they wanted (preferred and desired), as well as answering other users questions. This meant that a user can upload their own pictures and gifs to answer other users questions. Unfortunately, creating a GIF isn’t the easiest or most intuitive thing to do, so we plan on coming up with a way to make GIF creation easy for the user. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The rest of the weekend slipped away from me, it being mother’s day and all. I took the time to go over OAuth and the twitter application, mainly working with APIs and tokens. I didn’t get to work on the Delta app as much as I’d liked to.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The current link to the application is thedelta.herokuapp.com . Phil added some SASS using Bourbon and it looks great. I hope to get back on it and make some more contributions soon.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span></p>
<h2>Week 7 Recap:</h2>
<p><span><strong>PHASE 3!</strong></span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So this entire week has gone by, so I’ll try to sum everything up without divvying everything up day by day. I’m still a bit in shock that it’s Phase 3 already. Time is really flying by. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So Monday we were introduced to Rails, and what a beast it was. It’s like Sinatra, but bigger. Much bigger. We had a few exercises that took us through the Rails documentation and conventions. We had to quickly adapt to the new framework and it’s idiosyncrasies. I was a bit taken back by the new routes file and the controller set up. Once I got a grasp of the concept that the Sinatra controller was essentially broken into two pieces, it started to make much more sense. The use of “resources” in the routes file made life pretty easy; giving us the essential routes for a proper CRUD application. Even nested routes became easy, making RESTful routing a breeze. However, we quickly learned how nasty and difficult those nested routes can be to work with sometimes (forms, etc.). Throughout the week we created a number of simple applications using Rails, such as a craig’s list clone and blog site.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>We were also introduced to the real deal Rspec. We had been practicing with it, and using it here and there, but now, we didn’t write any development code without writing a test first. This became very frustrating very quickly. I felt like my knowledge of writing good tests was holding me back and slowing me down. I wanted to create good applications, but I didn’t want to waste any time. This really put the perspective on TDD (test driven development) though. Writing test slows you down a bit, which is definitely a good thing. It keeps you from getting twisted up in logic and loops that you can’t find yourself out of. <strong>It keeps you from over complicating your code. </strong>It helps you keep your code object oriented and simple. We were able to create rspec tests for the user features, the controllers, and the models. For the feature tests, we were able to incorporate the capybara gem, which mimics and simulates a users actions. It took a bit of time to pick up on the language and syntax, but once we got a bit into it, it was easy to formulate some tests. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I did however, break away from TDD, but only just a little. I wanted to explore the conventions of rails and get a good understanding of how it all tied together. I felt like I wanted to get a good grasp on one, before I tackled the other.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Our assignment for the weekend was a group assignment. Our group decided to create a music aggregator to collect music from different websites, such as SoundCloud, Hypem, and any other sites that had APIs. This project included everything we had discussed about group projects, such as stands, wire framing, retros, schema modeling, check ins, and we even used a trello board (<a href="http://www.trello.com">www.trello.com</a>). As a test, our instructors threw a curve ball at us later Friday afternoon and told us to switch code bases with another group. Completely. So we began working on another groups projects, right where they left off. Hopefully. While it was a bit frustrating as we were all pressed for time this weekend, it was an experience. It put perspective on how important it is to keep up with notes and the group’s overall status. It’s essential for the project’s success, really. After working on the other group’s code for a bit, we where instructed to move back to our own code base. We had the choice to implement any new features added by the other group, or to just delete them entirely. The other group passed a good few of our tests for us and include a pages controller (which we hadn’t thought of), so we decided to keep it.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Over the weekend I played around with the SoundCloud API. Turns out, it’s pretty easy to work with. I didn’t have much trouble including a search bar into my application, so that the user can add almost any song on sound cloud to their own playlist (some users have privacy settings, so I can’t say any song). I was even able to embed and display a mini SoundCloud player for each song on their play list. For our first release, we only incorporated SoundCloud, but I’m confident that most of the work has been done and adding a second or third API wouldn’t be too difficult.  </span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><span>We present Monday morning (Day 1 of Week 8). Once the app is up on Heroku, I will be sure to put the link up here. I know this was very brief, but hopefully I covered at least the surface of this past week.</span></p>
