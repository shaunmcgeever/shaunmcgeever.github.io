<p>Wednesdays are solo days.  I worked alone today, but sat amongst others. It was nice because I had my own main focus for the day, but I could consult anyone&#8217;s opinion just by looking away from my computer and speaking out loud.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s main focus was MVC, which represents Model, View, and Controller classes. The View displays the output to the user and gathers information. The View then sends this information to the Controller. The Controller interprets this user input and deciphers what action to take. The Controller then sends this information to the Model. The Model is the main computing/calculating engine of the program. The Model will perform the desired computing, and send the result back to the Controller. The Controller will then interpret that data and send it&#8217;s interpretation to the View. The View will display this data/computation/result to the user in a way that makes sense to the user. This basic functionality continues throughout the program. </p>
<p>I wrote two basic applications today: a To Do list and a Flashcard game (a game with definitions and answers). I wrote them both as functional programs. However, after learning about MVC, I refactored my code and applied these practices. Although it was a bit difficult to implement at first, the idea behind it totally makes sense. I wrote some code for the application with MVC in mind, and even though it was fully functional, the MVC concept was actually garbage. I was really heavy on the Model methods and barely had any View methods. It may take some time for the MVC to become instinctive, but I really agree with the concept behind it. I&#8217;ll probably get one of the instructors to look over it tomorrow.</p>
<p>We also had another Engineering Empathy discussion today (they&#8217;re usually Wednesdays). Today&#8217;s topic was &#8216;SuperEgo&#8217;. SuperEgo may have different meanings throughout different studies, like in ethics, politics, etc, but for our purposes, we mainly discussed our own inner monologue and it&#8217;s negative effects on our own self. A quick example: &#8220;You aren&#8217;t smart enough to be a programmer. You aren&#8217;t making the right choice&#8221;. The discussion as a whole was a pretty serious downer, but it was really nice to see that everyone has the same thoughts. This new environment, this new career move, everything about this program as a whole can make anyone second guess themselves (the idea of becoming an efficient &#8220;programmer&#8221; in 9 weeks still kinda baffles me). It is nice to be able to confide in each other and know that we are all feeling the same way together. We also discussed how to address this negative inner monologue, and how to curb the negativity. It was a heavy discussion, but it was a nice discussion to have.</p>
