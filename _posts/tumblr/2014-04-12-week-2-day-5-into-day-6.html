<p>Today (well, actually Friday&#8230;I&#8217;m writing this on Saturday) was a bit different. We began a new group project. The teachers introduced the idea of making a small functional console application, and did a quick demonstration on the idea brainstorming process. They then set us on our way, and we dove right in. It was definitely an experience. I have worked on multiple group projects in my under-grad studies, but working on a project with topic that is so new to everyone in the group was an experience. We quickly came up with a simple restaurant database type app. We came up with user stories and what functionalities the application would have. We laid out our schema and what tables we would create in our database. We then divided the work amongst the 5 of us. I paired up with Sahan and we worked on the View and Controller (still trying to get that MVC concept down). Johnathan took the model, which will use SQL to access the database. Justin and Ruben worked on creating the tables based on the schema and populating the database. We made 4 different files for each of the different assignments.</p>
<p>Sahan and I made some serious progress with the view and controller, and we are waiting for some input from the model. The whole experience brought a few topics/problems to light. It&#8217;s not as simple as dividing the work and just typing code. There are many initial working agreements that must be established. This is especially critical when working with variable, arguments, method, and class names. I essentially can&#8217;t call any methods from the model using the controller unless I know what it&#8217;s called. It&#8217;s also imperative to know how the data is being passed from file to file, e.g the use of data structures.Â </p>
<p>We presented our progress to the class, and everyone had some cool ideas. This was a good time to go over some presentation skills and all that. I&#8217;m excited to see everyone final and (hopefully) functional apps.</p>
<p>EARLY DAY 6:</p>
<p>We had a quick recap to go over the status of everyones file. Essentially we have to just match up method names, variable names, arguments and so on. We&#8217;ll see how it goes!</p>
