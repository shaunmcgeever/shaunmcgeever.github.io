<p>Today I paired with Justin.</p>

<p>So today we had two CSS drills to complete again, however Justin and I skipped them. We moved on to the more difficult JavaScript exercises. I do plan on coming back to the CSS drills though, hopefully sometime this weekend. Our exercise for the day was to make our JavaScript version of Ruby Racer include more OOP (object oriented programming) and make it more D.R.Y. (and if I haven&#8217;t stated this already: Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself). It proved to be a very challenging exercise. Justin and I are both more experienced with Ruby syntax, so working through the JavaScript logic was troublesome once again. We used the same game setup that I had created yesterday. We began to implement a sign in dialog box for two different users. We created the database, schema, migrations, tables, and models. We began working on the controller functions and how our application/game would send the information around using AJAX. However, we were severely held up by the front end. This is where our lack of JavaScript experience pulled us down, We could&#8217;t get the form to submit the information as we wanted it to. The logic of the game would constantly break and we would have to back track to fix our errors. We wanted to be able to move on, but unfortunately having the game start and finish properly was a key component to having a properly functioning back end. </p>
<p>We did eventually get a functioning front end, without any flaws. From there, we had used a huge chunk of time. I almost typed &#8220;wasted a lot of time&#8221;, but as I think about it, I know it wasn&#8217;t a waste. From today alone, my jQuery skills and overall JavaScript syntax has improved tremendously. By the end of it, I was able to pick out any element and add or remove CSS classes with ease. And that was definitely fun to learn. Also, finally getting down the proper format of a JavaScript if/else statement and becoming more comfortable with JavaScript overall was a small victory.</p>
<p>But as I said, we had spent a lot of time messing with the JavaScript and front end. When it came down to using AJAX to send our inputs/messages to create our Users and Games, we decided to skip it. We both felt like we had practiced the Ruby back end enough to move past it. We had been practicing that all last week. It would have certainly been a challenge, don&#8217;t get me wrong,  but due to a lack of time we decided to put our newly learned OOP in Javascript to the test. We had a lecture on OOP in Javascript today, so we discussed the importance of Objects. We learned the different ways to create Objects and when/where/why/how these ways are best used. I&#8217;ll be honest, I didn&#8217;t quite understand most of the lecture, but I did understand the importance of it all. Just like many things overlap from language to language, I can see the many similarities of JavaScript Objects to Ruby Objects. I know they are crucial to learn and it will be imperative to use them in my code, so I know this isn&#8217;t a topic to breeze over. Hence why Justin and I tried to get into it in today&#8217;s challenge, rather than messing with Ruby elements we were already comfortable with. We were able to refactor quite a bit, and we did learn a great deal, especially with assigning attributes and prototype functions. I am still a bit fuzzy on most of it though, but we will be touching on it again on lecture again tomorrow, and now I know the right questions to ask.</p>
