  <p>So today marks the start of Phase 2. In Phase 2, we will be studying and introducing ourselves to many new technologies. We will be getting deeper into HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as bringing jQuery, HTTP, Ajax, Sinatra, OAuth, and Background Jobs into the mix. I can&#8217;t say I have even heard of OAuth and Background Jobs, but I am excited to learn them all. </p>
<p>Phase 2 will look something like this:</p>
<p>Week 1: Web Fundamentals</p>
<p>Week 2: Front End</p>
<p>Week 3: Web Apps </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t wasn&#8217;t given an outline of learning goals for the week, but I&#8217;ll still go over what we go through day by day.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Today I paired with Neal.</p>
<p>Today the new cohort of 22 students came in. They will begin Phase 1, just like I did three weeks ago. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll have a good amount of questions for us that have completed Phase 1, so I look forward to that. It&#8217;ll help keep me on my Ruby-toes while I work on my Front End skills. Today we began working on CSS and HTML styling sheets. We did basic layout challenges, reformatting blogs to have left hand, right hand, and top navigations. We had a lecture on the internet as a whole and basically how it works, specifically the relationship between the client and the server. We went over Get, Post, Put, and Delete. Very similar to SQL&#8217;s CRUD methods. We also went over a standard Sinatra skeleton and how it is implemented.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we opened up Sinatra for ourselves. We did a few small, quick challenges to get ourselves used to the skeleton. We then jumped into a more difficult challenge. We made a small application/webpage that receives a user input and returns all possible anagrams of that word. We loaded a 250,000 dictionary into a database. We combined Ruby, ActiveRecord, HTML, and Sinatra to produce this program. It was close to mind blowing when I used an embedded Ruby file for the first time. It was very different to be able to use Ruby code in a HTML document. After we got the app running, we tweaked our existing Ruby code to make it more efficient. We adjusted our queries to the database and we were able to produce the answers a bit faster. </p>
<p>I really look forward to learning some front end skills. For the past 3 weeks (plus 12 weeks of Phase 0) we have only made apps that run out of the console. I can&#8217;t wait to bring some life to these programs.</p>
