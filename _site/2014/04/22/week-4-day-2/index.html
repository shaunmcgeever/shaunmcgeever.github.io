  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Today I paired with Adam.</p>
<p>Our first two assignments were with HTML and CSS. We made a tabbed interface, as well as a blog page with a fixed, top navigation bar. These two were relatively simple, and didn&#8217;t take much time to complete. It was actually really fun. In our first lecture of the day, we covered some JavaScript. We went over some DOM manipulation and reviewed JavaScript functions. I&#8217;m still a bit uncomfortable with the functions, but I&#8217;m getting good practice with the exercises. </p>
<p>In the afternoon we had two exercises with debugging a Sinatra app and an asynchronous form. The debugging Sinatra app exercise was a good one. The difference between get and post was really drilled in. We debugged a few errors and used puts statements to make our way through the app. We were able to follow the flow through the app. Once the app was running smoothly. We added a basic form and implemented a number of options, e.g. radio buttons, drop down lists, check boxes, and a text area. With these options, we examined how the parameters were passed along the back end side, using the console.  The second exercise, the asynchronous form, was a lot tougher. The point of an asynchronous form is to send and receive data to/from the server without reloading the current webpage. We knew we needed to perform some kind of combination of ajax and javascript, so we tried to put a few things together. However, we really couldn&#8217;t figure it out. We had a general idea of logic, but general syntax really limited what we could actually do. We did our best before the afternoon lecture, but sure enough, the topic of the afternoon lecture was ajax. We went over how the ajax method works along with Javascript, JSON, and jQuery. We went over a few ajax methods, but specifically the post and &#8220;.done()&#8221; methods. Well we went over a few others, but these two were the ones we were missing from our afternoons assignment. After implementing these two methods, we hit a few more syntactical road bumps, but we eventually muscled our way to an answer. Once again, I hope the struggle pays off and really drills the concept into knowledge.</p>
<p>All the new languages are a bit overwhelming, but hopefully it&#8217;ll all come together in the next few weeks. </p>
