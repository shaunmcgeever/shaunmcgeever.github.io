  <p>We finished up the application last night. It was cool to see everything come together. It worked surprisingly well, but I am sure that is not always the case. We hit a few discrepancy errors when including the 4 different files, but once we worked out the bugs it ran pretty well. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to implement all of our user stories, but we had a functional app nonetheless. We used information from the Yelp API to help populate our database. So without some of our desired user stories/functionalities, it&#8217;s kinda just a Yelp/Foursquare type app&#8230; oh well. We decided to just leave it at that for the time being. The point of the assignment was to manage all the difficulties when working in larger groups on large projects. We made it through that part, got something running, and decided our time could be spent studying different topics.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of today reading POODR (Sandi Metz) and some articles pertaining to databases, as well as reviewing the material from the past week. It&#8217;s crazy that two full weeks have passed already.</p>

<p>ALSO, almost forgot to add: the learning goals for this week.</p>
<ol><li>Translate specs or user stories into an object-oriented application</li>
<li>Understand the object model in Ruby</li>
<li>Appropriately use classes, modules, inheritance, and composition (“good OO design”)</li>
<li>Defend and apply best practices such as the single responsibility principle and decoupling</li>
</ol><p>After Friday&#8217;s project, numbers 1 and 2 seem like breeze. I know them in and out. Number 3 is a bit iffy. I know how to use each of them, but as for when I should use each one, I&#8217;m not so sure yet. I hope that just comes with experience. I&#8217;m reading a lot about Number 4 in POODR. I understand the logic and reasoning behind it, I just have to remember to bring that along when I start writing code. I&#8217;m sure this will only get better with experience as well.</p>
