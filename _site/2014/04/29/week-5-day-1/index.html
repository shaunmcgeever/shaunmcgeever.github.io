  <p>Week 5 (Week 2 of Phase 2) is Front End. I am excited to see what the challenges will hold.</p>

<p>Today we presented our projects from the past weekend. It was great to see how everyone faired up. Every group went over what they struggled with technically and personally within the group. We didn&#8217;t have many personal issues this time around, but we did, like many of the groups, struggle with the git work flow. So we will be going over that this week, which ends up working out pretty well.</p>
<p>During our lecture for the day, we went over some of the uses of javascript. We examined a blog page with many posts and each post having tags. As a whole group, we discussed and created created radio buttons to filter through all, published, and unpublished posts. This wasn&#8217;t too difficult as published was a direct attribute of the post. We also created a search bar to search through the posts for specific tags. This was all done using javascript to add hidden classes to the posts. We did something similar for our flashcard app this past weekend. However, with any tag, it becomes a little more difficult; tags were created as a separate objects. We can set the tag_name attribute in the post model so that its easily accessible from the view. We can then iterate through all the posts and identify which we want to hide and which we want to show.</p>
<p>As for exercises, I paired with Timmy today. My group of four for the week consists of Timmy, Justin, and Phil. Our first two exercises were once again some CSS styling drills. We created a fixed+side navigation bar, as well as messed around with DOM manipulation using Chrome Developer tools. This was really just to practice grabbing different kinds of elements using jQuery. It&#8217;s really useful to see what you can do in real time, and then apply that information when creating a javascript file.</p>
<p>Our final exercise was to recreate the &#8220;RubyRacer&#8221; exercise, but this time using only javascript. As a reminder, the point of RubyRacer was to print and display a small board and have players advance across the board a certain amount of spaces determined by a randomly generated number. This proved to be a bit difficult, as it was the first time we were introduced to real javascript logic. It took some time to get adjusted to the syntax, but eventually it worked out. I was able to have each players car advance whenever a key was pressed (&#8220;Q&#8221; for player one and &#8220;P&#8221; for player two). The random luck was removed, but it&#8217;s not like it requires much skill&#8230; We added some css and formatting so that it looked pretty cool as well. We will be adding to this assignment tomorrow by adding some backend logic.</p>
