    <h1>Week 2 Begins: Day 1</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Week 2 began today. I feel a bit more comfortable after ironing out some of the kinks in my routine, like commuting and stuff, so hopefully that helps out with the studying. I plan to put some more time in next weekend and manage my study time and free time more effectively. </p>
<p><span>The overall learning objective for the week is Object Oriented Programming. More specifically:</span></p>
<ol><li>Translate specs or user stories into an object-oriented application</li>
<li>Understand the object model in Ruby</li>
<li>Appropriately use classes, modules, inheritance, and composition (&#8220;good OO design&#8221;)</li>
<li>Defend and apply best practices such as the single responsibility principle and decoupling.</li>
</ol><p>I will check in at the end of each day and the end of the week to see how I touched on these different topics.</p>
<p>Todays activities:</p>
<p>I should explain how pairing actually works at DBC. As a pair, we each have our own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but only one CPU. We essentially have our own work station, but we are working on the same files and programs. Obviously we cannot both type simultaneously, so we take turns &#8220;driving&#8221; and &#8220;navigating&#8221;. The driver&#8217;s responsibilities include actually typing the code and using the keyboard and mouse. The driver can focus on variable names, method calls, etc. The navigator usually has a broader scope, keeping the bigger picture in mind. Feedback is also huge at DBC. We have been taught how to give effective feedback (specific, actionable, and kind), and how to avoid all the BS. All of the previous pairing sessions have used this model. </p>
<p>My pair today: Buck.</p>
<p>Todays topics included &#8220;advanced ruby&#8221; and OOP foundations. I was a bit hesitant as to what advanced ruby entailed, but we dove right in. We went over specific enumerable methods and studied their functions. For example, we studied the uses of blocks, procs, and lamdas. We studied how #each actually works (how it really yields to a block), which leads directly into #map and #select methods. </p>
<p>We benchmarked iterative and recursive solutions to the Fibonacci sequence. We created subsets and combination functions using recursion.</p>
<p>The most important topic for me today was the self keyword. We studied specifically class methods and instance methods. Before today, I kinda just threw the self call anywhere I thought it made sense, and just debugged from there. I thought it just meant the object it was called on was considered &#8220;self&#8221;, but that was only half right. I now know the difference between class methods (using self in the method name) and instance methods (using self within the method) and their different functions. </p>
<p>Another topic was the differences and applications of inheritance and composition, as well as classes and modules. (specifically number three on that list!).Most of my programs to date have been composition programs, but it was cool to see how inheritance and hierarchy works. Also, I had no idea what a module is, but now I can consider it as my new &#8220;toolbox&#8221; class. Basically, I can make a module and throw a bunch of methods in there that can be used throughout the program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading POODR by Sandi Metz, and I plan to continue and finish it by the end of the week&#8230;. Hopefully I can squeeze that in.</p>
<p>I can definitely be more specific with daily posts, so I hope to keep this up.</p>
