  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Today was a review of SQL and databases. My pair was Insung. We drew up a few different schemas depicting the different types of database design. We reviewed the one to one, one to many, and many to many relationships. We did a fair amount of this in Phase 0. After reviewing the designs today, we created a ruby file including the SQLite3 gem, which was pretty cool. We modeled and created a fake database using a downloadable gem called Faker. We made our database model using authors, books, and publishers. For the sake of the assignment: an author can write many books, a book can have multiple others, and a book is published by a single publisher (but a publisher can publish many books). We made sure to include the foreign and primary key values so that the three tables are linked. We added SQL join, insertion, update, and delete methods to our ruby file. I thought it was cool to implement two different languages in a single file. We went over other basic models, like address books, student rosters, etc. I&#8217;ll probably review them some more over the weekend.</p>
<p>Thursday nights DBCX speaker: Vinicius Vacanti, Co-Founder and CEO of Yipit.  This was a really captivating talk. Vinicius spoke and presented a powerpoint explaining the process behind building an idea into a product. He discussed the success of many other start ups, and what it was that made those companies so successful. He talked about failures and bad ideas, and the learning process behind each one. He was able to relate and describe his own story of failure and success very well. He was a self-taught programmer, so it was relatable on a personal level (even though I&#8217;m not entirely self taught). It was a really powerful discussion about finding a niche, coming up with an idea, and executing properly. The MVP of Yipit was created in three days (which I thought was incredible), but that was after two and a half years of unsuccessful attempts.  I really enjoyed his talk; it got me excited to get involved with the tech community.</p>
