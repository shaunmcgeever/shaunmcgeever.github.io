  <p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Today I paired with Brendan</p>
<p>The first exercise of the day was to take a functioning app and replace some of the functionalities with AJAX. The app displayed a button that allowed you to &#8220;roll a dice&#8221; it would randomly display one of six images, corresponding to each side of a dice. The app would reload the page every time with this new image. Our goal was to use AJAX and gather the information needed and display the new image without reloading the page entirely. It was a simple concept, but implementing the AJAX was a bit troublesome. This was our first assignment with local images. The lecture and assignments from the previous day definitely helped, but it still wasn&#8217;t as easy as 1-2-3. By the time I finished though, I definitely had a good understanding of AJAX and it&#8217;s uses and advantages. The second exercise was to create a URL shortener (something similar to bitly). This exercise really focused on redirects and utilizing the database. I was able to redirect and navigate through our webpage, all while creating new entries and retrieving entries from the database when needed. The overall flow of a web app was making morse sense.</p>
<p>Our lecture for the day was about sessions and cookies. I&#8217;ve always had a rough understanding of cookies, but it was great to discuss what they are actually used for. Although I didn&#8217;t need to implement them in any of my assignments today, I know I will be soon.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4:</strong> Today I paired again with Brendan</p>
<p>Our first exercises for the morning were a few CCS drills. We worked on typesetting and Page Navigation. They weren&#8217;t too crazy, but I definitely enjoy it. I&#8217;ve never been one to draw or do anything artistic really, but I&#8217;ve always dreamed to be able to. I feel like this may be my way of art that I&#8217;ve been looking for. It&#8217;s like structured, well planned and thought out, designed kind of art. I look forward to making a fully functional app and then taking the time to making it look aesthetically awesome. The back end exercises for the day were blog related exercises. For example, we first created an anonymous blog. Any one could post to this blog and view all the posts created. Each post could have tags, which introduced a tricky situation in our database (a many to many relationship), but it came out nicely with the addition of a join table. After this app created, we moved on to creating users and authentication. The plan was that users can sign in, view all posts but edit and delete their posts. This is where the lecture from yesterday came into play. I was able to store some of the user&#8217;s information in the session, like the user&#8217;s id, so that I could keep track of it as I redirected from page to page. The authentication was cool too; we took the input information from the user and checked it against the data in the database. Essentially, we took the email the user had inputted, checked the database for that email, and checked to see if the password the user also filled matches the password stored in the database. There were also a few validations (utilizing ActiveRecord) during sign up to verify that emails were unique, properly formatted, and that no fields were left blank. I quickly learned that ActiveRecord returns very helpful error messages if any of these validations fail, and it was very easy to work with. We also had a logout feature which essentially cleared all stored information from the session. I was able to grasp all the logic behind the log in/out, authentication, and sessions, so it was a great exercise for me. I definitely had fun.</p>
<p>We also had a few discussions throughout the day covering any questions with AJAX and jQuery. So I am picking it up better day by day.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5: </strong>Today was a group project day. My previous pairs for the week made up our group. So it was Adam, Brendan, Neal, and myself.</p>
<p>We had a lecture to begin the day. We went over &#8220;Stands&#8221; and their uses in the workplace. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a tech-wide thing, but I&#8217;m sure each company has a variation or something similar. We discussed how to break up the work, like we discussed last week, but we also added in how to keep status of all the work. For example, our group can hold a quick meeting and each member can say what they&#8217;re working on and if they are being &#8220;blocked&#8221; by anything. Being blocked is essentially waiting on any type of information or work from anyone else; something that is holding you back from completing your assigned work. As a whole group, we did a mock of creating a blog application. We discussed how to decide what tasks are critical to complete and which can be put in the &#8220;ice-box&#8221; and held off for a later date. From the tasks that are critical to complete, we went over how to decide how time will be managed. As a group we would decide how much time we thought it would take to complete each task. For example 2 hours to create and seed the databases, 1 hour to create user authentication, etc. We decided what would be done in 8 hours and where we should be at the end of the day. We also agreed to check in throughout the day to make sure everyone was still on track and to see how everything was progressing. I&#8217;ve had prior experience with this stuff at my old job, but we did it on a weekly basis. The daily meet ups definitely make more sense, especially when there can be heavy dependancies on others to complete their work for the project to move forward.</p>
<p>The assignment for our group (which was the same for every group) was to create a flash card app. I immediately liked the idea of the project, as we had already created a similar app, but we only used ruby. So I had a rough idea of what we needed to do, but just to implement our new web/server/database skills. Essentially, our app would display a card, and the user would enter an answer, and we would check to see if that answer was correct. We would create users, multiple decks, and a scoring system. As a group we designed our schema and what functions our app would have. We decided what we wanted to have done by the end of the day, split up the work, and agreed to check in throughout the day with each other. Adam and I worked together on creating the models and the authentication process. I was able to practice the authentication process, like I had done in the earlier in the week. I feel really comfortable with that at this point. We then moved on to making methods to check if the answer is correct and to update the user&#8217;s score respectively.  We struggled a bit with the git work flow, so I know I need to practice on my git commands. I know what I want to do with git, but sometimes I just don&#8217;t know the proper commands, e.g. reverting to a previous commit. I also need to go over the merge concept. We worked on separate files for the most part, so we avoided most merge conflicts, but we did hit one or two.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we had our app functioning well. It did all the basic functions that we had set out to do. We even added some Bootstrap for CSS, so it didn&#8217;t look to bad either. We were all happy with that. We all worked together, so I think we were lucky. We witnessed a few groups struggling to make any kind of progress. We had some ideas of new things to implement, like high score and allowing the user to implement their own decks, so we may add those features (as well as overall styling and appearance) over the weekend. However, our biggest assignment from the instructors was to take our app and implement AJAX functions when possible. That task is a bit more daunting, but it will be great practice and I&#8217;m sure we will be able to get it done. I hope to get most of that done, as well as taking some time to review JavaScript, jQuery, and Git flow this weekend.</p>
