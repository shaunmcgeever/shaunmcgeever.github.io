    <h1>Week 3 Recap (Days 3 to 7)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Apr 20, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>So this week got a bit busy. I&#8217;ll go over the past few days and give a quick recap of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Wednesday is solo day, but I decided to pair up anyway. I paired with Brendan.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s main focus was ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is the Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) we will be using most frequently. The instructors gave us a brief lecture, but didn&#8217;t reveal too much before letting us get our hands dirty. We dove in and started making schemas, creating tables, and learning about migrations. To be honest, without knowing too much about it, it was got a bit frustrating. At times we were clueless.  But we managed to make our way through most of the problems, after much research of the docs, google searches, and scanning stack overflow. Today was one of the first days were I really felt unaccomplished, and that I didn&#8217;t grasp the concept entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4:</strong> I paired up with Brendan again.</p>
<p>The instructors gave a second lecture on ActiveRecord. This is when everything clicked. Almost everything we had struggled with yesterday was explained in the lecture. We all asked questions throughout the lecture and my understanding just grew and grew. The constant struggle from yesterday just opened my eyes to what I really wanted and needed to know. Brendan and I went back and finished the assignments from yesterday. We rewrote most of it, but it took us a quarter of the time. Also, after the assignments on Tuesday, it was amazing to see what ActiveRecord actually does for you. It&#8217;s a very helpful and powerful tool. The second assignment for today was to re-do an assignment from last week. I made a simple to do list program, which read data from a csv file. This week, I used a database to hold the tasks and remade the app using ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is awesome.  The speaker for tonight was the CTO of New York, DBC. He spoke about functional programming, and what &#8220;functional&#8221; programming actually means. He explained the concepts of programs and variables changing state. He explained how that can be problematic, as the state of the program can depend heavily on time. It was a cool concept to keep in mind. </p>
<p>I also had a brief 20 minute assessment. I sat with one of the instructors and we worked out a problem to make sure I am on track to continue with the program. The problem included creating a menu with items and corresponding prices, adding gluten free features, sorting items by price, creating a database and tables to hold the menus and items. I felt pretty confident with the assignment, even though I was a bit nervous while typing it out.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5:</strong> Today was an open source project day.</p>
<p>We had a lecture on open source, and it&#8217;s benefits to the community. I think it&#8217;s a pretty awesome concept, and the culture behind it is great. We broke off into groups and began coming up with ideas for a new application. Our group had 8 members at first, which seemed like a lot. We all brainstormed ideas together and then broke off into three teams afterwords. Buck and I teamed up together. Our idea was to create a Random Tweet Generator for a celebrities timeline. For the time being, we stuck with Jaden Smith (Will Smith&#8217;s son), mainly because he tweets absolute &#8220;philosophical&#8221; garbage. We created the app to connect with the Twitter API, which I haven&#8217;t worked with before. It was cool. We had the app bring in the most recent 200 tweets. I believe we were limited due to the access level of my developer status/API Keys. I have to look into this more. But anyway, we took those 200 tweets and stored them into a temporary array, filtered through them by retweet count, and dropped the ones that didn&#8217;t have a set number of retweets. This removed most of the tweets that no one cared about. We then stored these tweets into a database. We were then able to pull a random tweet from the database, whenever the program ran. For example, some great inspiring tweets:</p>
<p>"How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren&#8217;t Real"</p>
<p>"If Everyone In The World Dropped Out Of School We Would Have A Much More Intelligent Society"</p>
<p><span>"If Newborn Babies Could Speak They Would Be The Most Intelligent Beings On Planet Earth."</span></p>
<p><strong>Nice.</strong> We wrote the program in such a way that you can actually change the user you want to search and pull tweets from. But why would anyone want to do that&#8230;</p>
<p>I also spoke with the instructors and my assessment from the previous day went very well. They were satisfied with my progress and I&#8217;ll be moving onto Phase 2 on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>This weekend</strong> I took some time to myself after the busy week. I caught up on some reading, as well as some obvious blogging. I went home for the Easter Holiday, but I&#8217;m ready to get back into it and start Phase 2.</p>

<p><strong>To recap the learning goals of Week 3:</strong></p>
<ol><li>Design a relational database to represent collections of entities and the relationships between them</li>
<li>Write SQL queries to extract desired information from a database</li>
<li>Understand how to connect Ruby programs to a database using both hand-written SQL and an ORM like ActiveRecord</li>
<li><span>Describe what an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is and how it works on a high level</span></li>
</ol><p>I think after this past week I have a good understanding of all four goals. I had prior experience designing the relationships of databases and writing SQL from Phase 0, but I only strengthened those skills this week. The newest thing was 3 and 4. I may not be an expert on ActiveRecord just yet, but I think I have a good understanding of its usefulness, and I appreciate it&#8217;s overall power and complexity. I will be working with ActiveRecord very closely over the next 6 weeks, so I&#8217;m sure that skill will only get stronger. I don&#8217;t know how any other ORMs work, so I may take some time to go skim over that this evening. I don&#8217;t want to be completely limited to ActiveRecord, without knowing what else is available. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing to think that I&#8217;m already 3 weeks through the program. I hope the next two phases don&#8217;t pass as quickly. I&#8217;m really enjoying the program and the journey.</p>
