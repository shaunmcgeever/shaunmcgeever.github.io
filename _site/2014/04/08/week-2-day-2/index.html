  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Today we got more involved in object oriented programming (OOP). I paired with Julia today. The main focus of today&#8217;s challenges were to make small, but fully functional, terminal based applications. For example, for one application, we made a basic hospital interface. We can add a new hospital, along with it&#8217;s employees, and add new patients as they come in. Everyone has their own username and password. The hospital interface has it&#8217;s own validation methods. The doctors can log in and have full accessibility to the methods (basically administrative rights), where as the patients and other employees have limited access. It was a simple application, adding patients and symptoms, but it was cool to see the very basics. </p>
<p>We also had a lecture on test driven application. Which is essentially working from the most simple base case, expecting to fail, writing code to make that simple case pass, and then finding the next most simple case and making that pass. Essentially this would continue and repeat until you completed your program. It is a bit more involved than just that, but that&#8217;s the main focus.</p>
<p>We also implemented assert and assert_equals methods to test our programs today. I have to start doing this more. It should eventually be instinctive.</p>
<p>I hope to get through some more of POODR tonight, as it is incredibly applicable for the OOP topics.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m not sure if I mentioned, but we have been using git to push all of our solutions and files to github. I&#8217;m slowly becoming pretty efficient with the terminal and it&#8217;s great. Using the mouse is slowly becoming useless;  it feels weird, but it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s a small feat, but it can make anyone feel like an actual programmer.</p>
