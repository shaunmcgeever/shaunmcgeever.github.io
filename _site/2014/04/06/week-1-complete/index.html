  <article class="post-content">
  <p>So it&#8217;s currently Sunday night and I have survived week one of Dev Bootcamp (DBC). Just to reemphasize, DBC is a 9 week course that teaches me the skills to be a &#8220;world class junior level web developer&#8221;. What that all includes is up to me. I will be taught how to pair and work with others, how to be a proficient learner (which is huge as the tech field is constantly growing), how to be humble, and of course how to code/program/debug/design efficiently. Even after only one week, DBC has provided me with more resources that I can even keep up with.  In preparation of these 9 week, DBC provided me with a 12 week introductory/preparation course (Phase 0). I completed the Phase 0 course work at home, while I worked full time. I started Phase 0 January 6th 2014. It was only after week 2 or 3 of Phase 0 when I knew this was the right decision, and that this course was a good fit for me.</p>
<p>To be more specific, some of the more technical things I plan to learn at DBC: Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and hopefully others. I have touched on all 5 of these topics during Phase 0. I have yet to tie them all together (other than HTML and CSS), so I am excited to see how that will all work out. Of the 12 weeks in Phase 0 (this is all a rough time line), the first 7 weeks were all Ruby, then SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were all introduced week by week. The final 2 weeks were review and final prep for the real deal. </p>

<p>Starting March 31st, I began DBC at 48 Wall Street.  The 9 weeks are broken up into three Phases. I have completed Week 1 of Phase 1.</p>
<p>I will try to keep this blog as up to date as possible, whether that is daily or, at the very least, weekly. I have noticed that my free time during the week is minimal. <span>I know it was only the first week, but I didn&#8217;t leave earlier that 11:00pm any night this week, and came in on Saturday as well to review and read new material. I&#8217;ll take the time now to go over some of the stuff we did.</span></p>
<p><span>Monday:  Basic Introductions, explored the new environment, coded briefly. Worked on &#8220;Numbers to words&#8221; and &#8220;Numbers to Roman Numerals&#8221; exercises. </span></p>
<p><span>Tuesday: My pair for the day: Payam. Reviewed Solutions to &#8220;Roman Numerals&#8221;. Examining other peoples code and solutions opened up my eyes to the vast number of possibilities of any one problem, no matter how simple. We then dove into sorting algorithms. We examined pseudocode and worked out how to translate that into functional ruby. I dove into a merge sort, got in way over my head, and moved to an insertion method. I was able to finish that effectively, and it didn&#8217;t seem so bad after struggling with merge sort for hours haha.</span></p>
<p>Wednesday: My pair: Adam. We worked on learning the different available data structures and their practical uses. We made a few of our own, such as queue, stack, and set. This was cool because we made our own methods to particularly use. We also discussed Big O notation and its uses. It made sense to discuss this after working on the many different examples of sorting algorithms the day before. We had an Engineering Empathy discussion today (EE). EE is a presentation and open discussion on different topics that exist in the work field. This week&#8217;s topic was Sexism. In a male dominated field, this issue certainly exists. To keep it short and sweet, we discussed different situations, shared experiences, and other thoughts and feelings on the matter. Sexism obviously exists, but we can learn to do our part to speak up and stop it in the work field. </p>
<p>Thursday: My pair for the day: Adrian. Worked on &#8220;ruby racer&#8221; which was a simple game. Player A and Player B take turns rolling dice, and the first to reach a cumulative score of 30 (or greater) wins. All we had to do was hit ruby ruby_racer.rb in the terminal, sit back and watch. We then worked on a boggle solution. This was a bit tougher. The program would print  a boggle board, ask the user to input a word, and the program would check to see if that word existed in the board. We tried to implement the newly learned linked list data structure. That way the program could retrace its steps as it went through its search, effectively making a tree. I learned that this was a breadth search. It was a bit tough to implement. We got the code functioning and working, but only 90% of the time. It would get buggy if it had to go back more than 2 links on its linked list. It would start over completely rather than continuing with the third. I&#8217;d like to revisit this problem.  DBCX: DBCX is a chunk of time DBC sets aside and tries to get speakers to share their experiences, like TEDX (get it?). This week&#8217;s speaker was The Electric Sheep. Really cool concept of the hybrid of technology and art. I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Friday: My Pair: Insung. We went right into Sudoku today. This was the first problem that we had that we couldn&#8217;t visualize entirely in our head. We pseudocoded for at least 2 hours, trying to just wrap our head around the problem. We eventually got a working solution, that can solve very easy problems. It gets buggy when there is more than one possibility per box after it checks and reduces the board once over. I am thinking about implementing a guessing method, and try to brute force our way to a solution.</p>
<p>Saturday: Reviewed Sudoku. Tried to finish the logical method, and avoided the guessing method. I was not successful, but I am so close. I cannot complain though, as it is only week 1. I hope to be able to come back to this in 9 weeks and get a working solution in about hour. Let&#8217;s see if i can pull that off.</p>
<p>Sunday/Rest of weekend: I reviewed other materials, such as object oriented programming in preparation for week 2. There are so many resources at my finger tips. I wish there were more hours in a day. I want to be able to read and go over everything. I want to learn as much as I can. I really enjoy this stuff, and the whole experience is so new. I&#8217;m finally in an environment where I am interested in what I&#8217;m learning, and surrounded by people who feel the same. </p>

<p>Here are the expected learning goals for this week. I feel like I have definitely covered all of these topics.</p>
<p>&#8212;Understand principles of language structure and execution</p>
<p>&#8212;Write &#8220;driver code&#8221; to test and drive development</p>
<p>&#8212;Debug methodically and effectively</p>
<p>&#8212;Articulate algorithm design in multiple formats (pseudocode, image, verbal, plain english, etc.)</p>

<p>They suggested I take at least a half day off a week, so I did that today. I took the time to make this blog, so hopefully I can keep up daily. Daily posts can be more specific and more helpful to look back on. My only issue at this point is coming home late at night, and just saying screw it. I&#8217;ll do my best to keep up.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see where the next 8 weeks take me!</p>
