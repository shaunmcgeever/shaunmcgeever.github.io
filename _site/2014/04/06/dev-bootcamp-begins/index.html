  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I’m not much of a blogger, but I’ve been told many times that it would be wise to keep a blog and track my progress throughout the Dev Bootcamp experience. I can’t say I disagree. I’ll be able to go back and search through my thoughts, learning experiences, “aha!” moments, and any other notable experiences. I can’t promise it’ll be exciting stuff, but I’ll do my best to update as much as possible.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve come back to realize that I haven’t given much background information about myself. So I’ll jump back on this post to give some more information about where I am coming from, without getting too personal.</p>

<p><span>I graduated from The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) in May of 2012 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. At TCNJ I took one computer science course, but it mainly focused on C++. Throughout my career at TCNJ, I wrote multiple programs in C++, Matlab, LABView, G-code, and even FORTRAN. These were for a few different classes, ranging from different applications such as simple thermometers, heat dissipation, and dampening systems.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>After graduating, I began working as a design and manufacturing engineer for a manufacturing company. Our main products were heat exchangers, air ejectors, and condensers for naval use on nuclear powered submarines. My roles as a design engineer included (but not limited to) designing new components and calculating their weight/center of gravity, performing shock resistance and fluid induced vibration tests, and cost estimates. On the manufacturing side, it was more hands on with the current development of products. I was directly involved with the manufacturing process. I wrote work instructions for the machine and fabrication shops. I designed fixtures to aid the shop workers and to make the manufacturing process more efficient. I drew 3D models of these fixtures. I did program a little, but it was basic Numeric Control programs using G-Code.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>However, I left that job on March 21st, giving myself a little over a week to prepare for DBC. Without getting into specifics here, I didn’t see a promising future for myself within the company. I actually didn’t see a future in the mechanical engineering field either. It didn’t seem like a good fit for me. I wanted to be more involved with creating and building process, and being involved in bigger and greater things. I enjoyed coding and programming, and DBC seemed like a great opportunity to expand my skill set and learn about the world of web development.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I’ve always been a bit of a technology nerd, and I’ve always tried to keep on top of the technology trends. I’m excited to become a part of the tech culture. </span> </p>
