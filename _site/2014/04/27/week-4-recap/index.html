  <article class="post-content">
  <p>So this weekend I focused most of my time on the Flashcard app we were making. It came out nicely and I was very happy with the results. We were able to add all the features we wanted, including user login, calculating percent correct, viewing all previous rounds, and viewing all scores per deck. The viewing of past results and scores were specific to the user that was logged in, so we were thinking of adding a high score method to show the highest score from all users. We even implemented some AJAX, specifically when the user enters their answer. The answer is sent to the server, it is checked against the correct answer, and then sent back to the same page without having to reload. A hidden box was displayed using JavaScript, showing the user if they were correct or incorrect, and their score was updated accordingly.</p>
<p>During the project, I worked mainly with my partner on the backend portion of it. We were working more on the models and controllers, and how the information was sent from page to page. I was involved with the front end, but my other group members took care of the actual styling. We incorporated a lot of Bootstrap and it came out looking very nicely. I would have loved to be totally involved in both parts, but unfortunately that&#8217;s not how it works. I am glad I worked on the backend though. I feel like I was able to get the well needed practice of new topics from the past week. I have a good understanding of how CSS and styling works, so I didn&#8217;t feel like I was missing out on too much (although extra practice is never a bad thing). We will be presenting our projects to the other groups tomorrow, so we will see how ours sizes up. Either way, I was very pleased with the overall experience of this project. I know some projects/group member can hit many obstacles rather quickly, but I feel like we did a good job managing everything.</p>
<p>Currently, the app is still on Sinatra, so it can only be run locally. Depending on what we decide as a group, we may stop here or we may throw it up on the web somewhere. I&#8217;ll have to discuss that with the group.</p>

<p>As for a weekly recap, this flashcard app really captured everything. Everything I practiced and struggled through during the week came together in this one project. I went from &#8220;what the hell is AJAX&#8221; to &#8220;we NEED to have AJAX here, it will be awesome&#8221; and implemented it. Even aside from AJAX, Â from rendering new pages and redirecting, to implementing ActiveRecord on the backend, it was incredible to see everything come together. It was a good result after a frustrating week; I feel like I have learned so much already.</p>
<p>I will say, however, I still need to touch up on my git skills. On my local computer and github I am perfectly fine. However, when different forks, branches, etc get involved, I start to lose touch. For example, setting my remote settings and upstream/downstream kinds of things. Learning that this up coming week will be my own personal goal.</p>
