  <p>It&#8217;s the last week of Phase 2 and time is continuing to fly by. Managing time has been a bigger task than ever, but I&#8217;m not doing too badly&#8230;yet. Things may change during the end of Phase 3, but I won&#8217;t worry about that just yet.</p>
<p>Week 6 has been titled &#8220;Web Apps&#8221;. I forward to seeing what this all entails, but from a quick look over the weeks assignments, it looks like a lot of API work and an introduction to Heroku. Maybe I&#8217;ll be able to get something up on the web sometime this week!</p>

<p>Day 1:</p>
<p>Today I paired with Johnathan.</p>
<p>After presenting our weekends app projects, we had a lecture about restful routing. While restful routing isn&#8217;t essential, we discussed how it&#8217;s a good practice and a good convention to get used to. I know there are many conventions when developing with Active Record and Rails, so the more I can pick up early, the better. As for restful routing, it&#8217;s a good way to keep your erb&#8217;s and redirect URL&#8217;s neat and organized. It&#8217;s makes them easy to use, read, and understand.</p>
<p>The challenges for today started with two CSS problems (surprise!), but they also incorporated some Javascript. We made a style editing bar, where the user could input a CSS selector (header, body, h1, etc), a property (background-color, padding), and then a property (red, blue, 10px, etc). The Javascript grabbed the info from these fields and changed the page accordingly. Our second challenge was to add a &#8220;Add Comment&#8221; button to a thread page. The button could be clicked, a text area would show with a create comment button and the add comment button would be hid. When the create button was clicked, the text would be added to the page and the create button would be hid. This one seemed a bit more applicable, but both were pretty cool, binding events to HTML/CSS selectors.</p>
<p><span>Our afternoon challenges included playing with the Twitter API. We got Johnathans Twitters API keys/tokens and make sure they had read and write permissions. We knew we had to use these tokens to make requests to twitter, but we didn&#8217;t want to have them saved in our files. I had done this before in an earlier project (the random tweet generator), but we ran a bash script every time we loaded the app. This bash script would load the keys into the ENV (environment), making them usable throughout the session life of our terminal. However, this time I wanted to try it a different way. We were pointed in the direction of Dotenv. Dotenv is a gem that loads a &#8220;.env&#8221; from the source directory. We put our token variables into this &#8220;.env&#8221; and required the Dotenv gem, and all the work was done for us. It&#8217;s very similar to the bash script style, but a little but less hack-y. Of course, we made sure to include the &#8220;.env&#8221; file in our gitignore file so that it wouldn&#8217;t be pushed onto GitHub. </span></p>
<p><br/><span>We played around with the app for a while. In order to get a specific user or timeline, we had to make request to Twitter.  However, once we made the request, we should be able to hold that user value/information until we are finished with that user. In other words, we only wanted to make one call to Twitter. We didn&#8217;t want to have to open up a connection everytime we wanted any of the users information, especially if we had that information literally seconds before. We tried a few different things, but eventually made a class instance of our user and their tweets (to help prevent rate limiting, we only grabbed 10 tweets). We included Active Record and created a database. This made it easy to store the users information and their tweets. Once we made the original twitter request, we could make database calls rather than opening another connection. We were also able to use a little bit of logic and make a loop that would cache the tweets. Essentially, we could check when the last time we imported tweets, and if it had been longer than 15 minutes, we would make a request to Twitter and bring in new tweets. </span></p>
<p><br/><span>With all this fun stuff, we were able to make a simple Sinatra app that posted a tweet to Johnathan&#8217;s timeline (because he was the owner of the tokens). This was pretty cool to see. To be honest, I was a bit jealous, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be setting this up with my own tokens soon. </span></p>
