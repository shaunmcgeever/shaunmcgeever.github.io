  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Nothing too crazy going on the past few days. Yesterday we started running Jasmine tests on our Javascript. After going through some of the rough patches of implementing TDD with rspec, it didn&#8217;t seem all that bad with Jasmine. It&#8217;ll all come together with time and the TDD style of coding will all flow together. We wrote out a simple javascript game so that we could implement some TDD with Jasmine. It was actually a cool experience because the consistent testing helped keep the javascript object oriented. Way less stray code and spaghetti-ness. </p>
<p>Today, Wednesday, was pitch day for our final projects. Any student, in any of the phases, could pitch an idea. They had under a minute to do so. Once all of the pitches were in, we, the Phase 3 students, voted on which project they would like to work out. The instructors would then do their best to give everyone their top choice, and place the students into groups.</p>
<p>My original pitch was an idea that I had for a while. I ran track and cross country competitively in college. We would go out for daily runs, occasionally twice a day, with our weekly milage goals in mind. This meant logging your milage was a necessity. I&#8217;ve used a few different applications, but they can be very slow, hard to manage, and overall not user friendly. This would lead me to avoid logging miles, and I would end up trying to log a week or two&#8217;s worth of running in one sitting; which meant trying to recall where I was, who was I with, how far was the run, how long did it take, as many as 14 times. It shouldn&#8217;t have been so difficult to input &#8220;I ran 7 miles today&#8221; into an application. I wanted to make a quick and simple app that helped manage your log. nothing too heavy, and nothing over the top. Just simple. However, as an addition, I wanted to make an additional feature that could help you find local races to sign up for (e.g. charity 5ks or open collegiate races). This would be separate from the log, but if you found a race, you could add a reminder to your calculator. I found a few APIs that let you search for races in your area, and they provided a ton of information in JSON format, including geolocations. My plan was to place all of the races on a map, so the user could visually see where the races were taking place. It may save someone some time traveling 60-70 miles to run a 5k, when their neighboring town is hosting one the next day, 10 miles down the road. Also, there are many small features that could have been added, such as a pace calculator or forum board, so the idea could have always been expandable. Unfortunately it was not picked up by the rest of my class, so it remains to be done another day. Maybe after graduating DBC I could put some work into it.  </p>
<p>Phil, however, pitched his idea for the Delta application. We worked together on this in Phase 2, so I was still very excited to be a part of that team. We have a good starting point, since we were able to build some features and create ideas in Phase 2. The original is currently built in Sinatra, so I think we will be recreating it in Rails. We&#8217;ll meet as a group tomorrow to discuss many of the group topics. The group consists of Phil, Adrian, Johnathan, and myself. We present an MVP on Monday. The final deadline is next Friday (10 days of work total), and we will be presenting our application to the class and potential employers. I am excited to see how far we can take this project, and push our strengths, knowledge, and learning capabilities to the limit.</p>
