  <p><span>Day: 2 </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So today was full of lectures. If you would have told me I had to sit through lectures all day during my undergrad career, I don’t think I would have been the happiest camper. Today, however, was awesome. I’m not even sure that this was planned by the teachers, but there were enough questions on each topic, so they held optional lectures with Q&amp;A’s. I obviously attended every one of them. I figured I&#8217;d take some time this weekend to catch up on the daily exercises. I’ll try to recap everything I was exposed to today.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The morning lecture was a bit of an extension of yesterdays exercises, mainly focused on authorization and authentication. The difference between the two: authentication is <strong>who you are</strong>, while authorization is <strong>what are you allowed to do</strong>. Yesterday we built an application that could send a tweet to the creators timeline. This was because the client tokens belonged to the creator of this app. We discussed how this is changed so that we can create an app that tweets to anyone’s timeline.  For example, I could get my friend in LA to sign into my app and he could use it to tweet to his own timeline. This is done using OAuth and temporary tokens. We discussed how the user can sign into my app, I then send a request to twitter, twitter sends temporary generated tokens back to me, I redirect the user to a Twitter log-in/splash page, they sign in using their credentials, and then Twitter verifies this using the temp tokens created by my app. Once the user is authorized to use their Twitter, I can use my app to store their tokens into my database. This is much more efficient than storing their twitter credentials (i.e. username and password), for obvious reasons and for not so obvious. The obvious may be that a user may not want me to have their password saved somewhere someone can access it easily. That’s a fair point. What makes it beneficial for the both the app and app user is that the user can stop the relationship between their twitter and the app at anytime. No changing of passwords is needed, only new tokens are regenerated. This is also helpful knowing that a user my have their twitter linked to many different apps. No one would be impressed if they had to change their password every time they wanted to stop using their Twitter credentials on any app. I haven’t much practice with OAuth, but just this exposure helped paint the picture for me. One of the upcoming assignments is making an app that can have a any user tweet to their own timeline. We’ll see how that goes.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The afternoon held the gold mine. We had 4 mini lectures plus another long talk after dinner. The first topic was “advanced ActiveRecord”. Going into this, I wasn’t sure what advanced really meant. It was a bit intimidating at first, but it ended up being very cool and super useful. We discussed how to break ActiveRecord conventions. ActiveRecord is a very powerful program that can be very easy to use. However, it’s power and ease of use comes from some of the universal conventions it uses. This can become very limiting. For example, we talked ourselves into a total mess trying to describe the type of schema Twitter or Instagram has. There is an obvious User model. This User can follow other Users and other Users can follow them. So let’s make a join table connecting the Users table to the… Users table? Connecting to itself? That doesn’t seem like that would work. But what if we changed some of the names around. For example, what if a User had many Followers and Followings (things that they follow). While the naming may not be the best example, we made a clear distinction between the two. Now that we can make the different tables, we just have to tell ActiveRecord how to find these relationships. A quick example, this can be done using:</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>     User has_many :followers, class_name: “User”</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>This tells ActiveRecord to create the followers association, but know that it really is part of the user model/class. This, along with the other “advanced” work arounds we learned, will become more and more useful, especially when we want to create our own method names and such. It’s good to know that we do have these kinds of options and that we aren’t limited by anything in ActiveRecord.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>After ActiveRecord, we discussed a few hints and tips when working with CSS. Mainly tips dealing with CSS positioning. There have been many times when I want to move and position an object, but it just doesn’t behave like I thought it would. We went over some key concepts that we may have forgotten or overlooked at this stage in the game. For example, we touched on display vs positioning. Even though display intuitively means how it appears on the screen, it has a big impact on positioning. When using display, you have three options that affect positioning: block, inline, and inline-block. Each CSS element has a different default. For example, divs are block and spans are inline. What I took from the discussion is this. Blocks are big and chunky; they will take up the full width of the page. Inline elements are sleeker, their width fits to their context. Block-Inline elements are a hybrid of the two. They keep their large box like attribute, but they can be adjusted and modified with some styling. A quick tip was, “If it’s behaving funny, try block-inline.” Now positioning. We discussed static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Static and Fixed were easy to understand. Static is the ignored step-child. It is the default position setting, but it apparently isn’t used for anything. Fixed is as if the element is pinned to the front of the screen. Where ever you put it, it will remain there. A good example of fixed is a side or top navigation bar; something you want to see at all times, from anywhere on the page. Absolute and relative is where it gets a bit tricky. Absolute defines where it lays on the whole page, sort of like pinning it to the back of the screen. You can scroll past it and it will move with the page, but it is not within the flow of the page (e.g. text won’t be able to flow around it). Absolute elements are positioned from the upper left hand corner of it’s first relative parent. If it is not within any relative elements, it will be positioned based of the upper left hand corner of the whole web page. Relative positioning also moves the element around, but unlike absolute positioning, it remains within the flow of the page. This relationship between absolute and relative isn’t very easy to visualize at first, but I think I understand the overall idea. Of course, I’d love to get into some exercises and practice it. I found this discussion super helpful, but I’m not so sure that CSS isn’t witchcraft just yet.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>We had a surprise lecture on the bash profile. I say surprise because it’s not really in the curriculum, but enough people were asking questions about it to have a quick discussion. I think what we really wanted is to know how we can customize our own. I’ve changed the colors of my terminal and made a few aliases, but that’s about it. I don’t really know it’s full potential. So we began talking about bash and shell in general. Which led to the bash_profile, bashrc, and profile files. Which led to SSH and remote access. Which led to Unix and Linux discussions. Which led to writing basic shell scripts. Which led to just basic computer talk in general. We never actually got to the bash profile and how to customize it, but it was an awesome discussion nonetheless. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>We had yet another discussion (review at this point?) of object oriented JavaScript. We didn’t learn to many new tips or tricks, but we just went over as a group how to properly implement constructor functions and prototype functions. I was still a bit skeptical about the concept. I understand the values of object oriented programming, don’t get me wrong, but when I am only writing a few lines of JavaScript, why take all this time to extract it into similar objects? So I asked this question to the teachers, in similar words, and kinda answered my own question. It may not be worth it when writing a small script or loop, but on a large scale, it can be crucial. We haven’t been exposed to large scale JavaScript programs/files, so we may not be able to see the applications and uses just yet. Realistically, I know how important object oriented programming is in Ruby, so I can safely assume it’s just as valuable in JavaScript</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>This set us up for a nice segway into a talk/discussion with the company’s CTO, Miles. He has a ton of experience with JavaScript, and we convinced him to give us a talk on it. I’m not sure we knew what we wanted him to talk about, or if we just wanted to learn anything we could about the foreign topic. So he laid it out simply: he was going to speak about the history of JavaScript, where it is now, and where it is going. With that I was hooked. From what I know, JavaScript has this enigma of being some ugly computing language, but everyone is “forced&#8221; to use it. So I wanted to see what he had to say.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>As the story is told, JavaScript was written in ten days by Brendan Eich. At the time, Netscape was pouring a lot of time and money into creating the Java language. Netscape had plans to release it’s newest browser, and they wanted to include a nice treat of it’s new powerful language, Java, into it. Brendan Eich was tasked to create a mock language of Java to accommodate and support this new browser. They wanted it to look and feel similar to Java. So Eich completed his task and JavaScript, which was originally named to LiveScript, was released with the browser. He knew it was full of bugs and it wasn’t pretty, but he had to make deadlines. He had no idea that this language would one day take off.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The original hype around JavaScript was very low. Nobody really cared or knew about it. Everyone was concerned with this new power house, Java. I’m fast forwarding a bit, but it wasn’t until Google’s new Gmail feature when things started to change. When you loaded Gmail, you could view your all of email and switch between emails, including inbox and outbox, without having to reload the page. This was huge. How did they do it? With JavaScript. Making requests to the server and responding back to the client without having to reload the page was totally new and innovative. The action was coined AJAX. Everyone began to realize the real power behind JavaScript, and it became more and more popular. Keep in mind that this was only around 2004-2005, only ten years ago. The technology is still very young and JavaScript libraries are still continuing to grow. It doesn’t look like anything is coming up to take it’s place either. Node JS has been created, which is a software platform that uses applications written in JavaScript. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I know this was a terribly condensed and brief (&#8230;and shitty) summary, but it’s actually a very interesting story. I would recommend that any new programmer should take the time to do some research and read the story for themselves. It helps put some perspective on JavaScript.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>And P.S, before I forget, we obviously did two CSS drills this morning. We worked on some navigation bars and animated them to display and hide using different features like clicking or hovering. Nothing intense, but it was cool to play with some animations and jQuery.</span></p>
