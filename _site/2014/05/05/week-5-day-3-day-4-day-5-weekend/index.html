  <article class="post-content">
  <p>So the end of the week definitely got busy and I wasn&#8217;t able to get to this blog as much as I&#8217;d have liked to. I&#8217;ll recap everything briefly here.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3:</strong></p>
<p>Today I paired with with Phil.</p>
<p>As usual, we had two CSS drills to complete for the morning. I&#8217;m not sure how many times I&#8217;ve actually said &#8220;as usual&#8221; or &#8220;yet again&#8221;, but it obviously appears that CSS drills in the AM have been pretty routine. So I apologize if it seems like I am repeating myself. Our drills today were creating button styled navigation bar and a drop down menu. Unfortunately I rushed through the CSS again, which I also seem to do quite often, to get to the harder assignments. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like CSS, I actually love it and I think is awesome (which I think I actually mentioned previously). I just think that the fundamentals of CSS are easier to grasp and that I will only get better with practice. It&#8217;s unfortunate, but I think my time would be better spent learning more about all of the other languages and technologies. I know I have said it before, but I really want to chunk out some time this weekend to get some decent CSS practice in. </p>
<p>We also had an AM lecture on JS Scope. We discussed how the scope of variables and functions affect their uses and functionality. We went over local and global variables and when it is most efficient to use them. We also discussed the uses of &#8220;this&#8221;, which tied into our lecture about constructor and prototype functions from the day before. JavaScript is still a bit new, but I am starting the get the hang of it. Once I wrapped my head around the constant reoccurrence of key-value pairs, it started to make a bit more sense.</p>
<p>Our exercise for the afternoon was to create a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> Clone. If you&#8217;re familiar with the site, it doesn&#8217;t include many flashy lights or spectacular designs. We mainly focused on the content. We used the nokogiri gem to scrape the site. We were able to pull all the titles, posts, and links. We decided to leave comments out, so that we could create our own comment feature. By the end of it, our site was looking good and functioning properly. All of our links and redirects were working and we could have different users sign in and leave comments on each post. A user can view all posts, all comments on a post, and delete their own comments. For the sake of time, we didn&#8217;t include an edit comment feature. </p>

<p><strong>Day 4: </strong></p>
<p>We had a Phase 2 Mock Assessment today.</p>
<p>I believe I mentioned it before, but there is an assessment at some point during every phase. Last phase, it was a short 20 minute, one-on-one with a teacher. Phase 2, however, it is a 3 hour solo challenge. This week was only a mock assessment, so it is only practice for the real deal next week. We were told that this mock would be extremely comparable to the actual one next week, so we may see things we have not covered yet. After the three hours, we turned in what we had completed. After lunch, I sat down with one of the teachers and we took about a half hour to review everything I put together. The overall assessment looked like this:</p>
<p>-Problem 1: Given a Users table and a Skills table, create a &#8220;User_Skills&#8221; table (aka Proficiency table) that shows the users experience and type of education (formal/informal) for their specific skill. </p>
<p>-Problem 2: Style a plain, black text on a white background, blog using CSS without modifying any HTML.</p>
<p>-Problem 3: Recreate a mock of &#8220;Simon Says&#8221; using AJAX. A button can be clicked and causes a random square (out of 9 total) to change color.</p>
<p>-Problem 4: Overall Javascript scope and constructor methods.</p>
<p>I felt rather comfortable after completing the assessment. I was able to get through the last 3 problems very smoothly (with some help from google during the Javascript problem).  I know I made a botched job of the first problem. I didn&#8217;t use the correct relationship for the three models. I forgot the crucial &#8220;through&#8221;.  I made the following relationships:</p>
<p>Users have many Skills</p>
<p>Skills have many Users</p>
<p>Skills have many Proficiencies </p>
<p>Proficiencies belong to Skills</p>
<p>With this information, I can grab all the skills any user may have. From there I can grab all the proficiencies associated with that skill. However, when I wanted to display all of the users with their skills and proficiencies, I realized my major error. Without a direct association of proficiencies to users, I couldn&#8217;t access the information I needed when iterating through all of the users. I needed to include:</p>
<p>Users have many Proficiencies =&gt; <strong>through</strong> Skills</p>
<p>Proficiencies belong to Users =&gt; <strong>through</strong> Skills</p>
<p>This allowed me to directly call and find the proficiencies for each user (i.e User.proficiencies) as well as their skills (User.skills). This gave me much more freedom when it came to displaying all of my gathered information. Unfortunately, I did not have time to fix this mistake, so it looked pretty poorly. However, I know my mistakes and I know what I need to review for next week. I thought the assessment was fun and challenging otherwise; though I won&#8217;t let myself get to complacent. </p>

<p><strong>Day 5 (+weekend):</strong></p>
<p>Today we were assigned to another group project. The task given to the group (Timmy, Justin, Phil, and myself) was to create an application that mimics Survey Monkey. Essentially, we needed to make a form submission page that would allow a user to create a survey and host it on our application. Other users could sign in and take other users surveys. All the results can be viewed. A user could delete their own surveys. </p>
<p>As a group, we sat down and designed our schema. We used a cool application called Balsamiq to wireframe everything. Balsamiq is awesome. We were able to draw out how we wanted our final project to look. It became a map for the project. With this map, we could work independently and split the work accurately. It was easy to separate who was working on what when we had a visual representation.</p>
<p>We also nailed down our git work flow, which was great. We decided to create a master repo and fork off of it. We could create branches off our fork. We named these forks based on their core function, for example whether it was a chore, feature, or bug fix. For (another) example, chore/creating-models was one of my branches. We could push and commit these branches to our local repos, and from there we could submit pull requests to master. After another group member was able to review that code, they could merge it to master. While working, we could pull all changes down from master (using upstream), so that we could always have the most up to date copy. This helped to avoid merge conflicts tremendously. </p>
<p>I volunteered to work on the database relationships and models, seeing that I screwed that up during the week. I wanted the extra practice. If I had any questions, I had three other group members that could answer any of my questions.We decided on four models: User, Survey, Question, and Answer. We decided to keep everything simple for an MVP, so the answers would just be a rating of 1-5. It would essentially become a host for rating surveys. For example:</p>
<p>How much do you like Ruby?</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t like it, It&#8217;s okay, I&#8217;m indifferent, It&#8217;s good!, and I love it!!</p>
<p>Each option would have a value, ranging from 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest), respectfully.</p>

<p>The specific relations we made were:</p>
<p>Users have many Surveys</p>
<p>Users have many Answers</p>
<p>Surveys have many Questions</p>
<p>Survey belong to User</p>
<p>Questions have many Answers</p>
<p>Question belongs to Survey</p>
<p>Answer belongs to Question</p>
<p>Answer belongs to User</p>
<p>Unlike my assessment problem, we didn&#8217;t use any through relationships. We would have liked to join Questions to Users through Surveys (so questions that the user has created), but we would have also liked to join Questions to Users through answers (questions that the user has answered). Honestly, we did not how to approach this, because both implications would have resulted in a method call User.questions. Which way would Active Record react? We didn&#8217;t know. We did not use through, but we were able to access the data we needed using: </p>
<p>User.surveys.questions</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>User.answers.questions     (include a .surveys at the end to get an array of surveys they have completed too!)</p>
<p>We asked our teachers when they were available on Monday, and we were correct in thinking that Active Record would have a hard time understanding what was what. We learned that we could have created our own methods that would return the results we wanted. In hindsight, it seemed obvious, but we didn&#8217;t think to try it. Nonetheless, our approach worked. We were able to create a fully functioning CRUD survey application (although editing surveys seems a bit silly). This application was fun to complete. I was able to add a pie chart to the results page and totally surprised myself. During wire framing, I made the joke that we should include graphs and charts. It was only a joke because we wanted to keep it MVP, and none of us have ever seen anything like that before. But sure enough, my group member Phil found a cool pie-chart visualization in the Google JS API. The challenge was accepted. Phil and I worked with the DOM to grab the numbers off the results page and used some more javascript to load the data into the pie chart function. This was crucial because it did not need to make another database call, and it was rendered on each page as it loaded. This was great javascript practice and it added a great feature to our app. After that, I worked on some parts here and there, including the display pages of taking surveys, the user&#8217;s profile page, and the deleting survey function (obviously a user can only delete a survey they have created). Our CSS was pretty basic. We have a static top nav bar that is completely functional and adds a bit of character. I also forgot to mention that we used the Bcrypt gem to add a bit of security to our passwords and user authentication. I hadn&#8217;t used it before, but it&#8217;s awesome. It takes in a password and randomly generates a long number-letter string to store into the database, rather than storing the user&#8217;s actual password.  Cool stuff. Overall it was a good project and I was pleased with the outcome. My git work flow was definitely improved and I am feeling much more confident using git. </p>
<p>I was able to find some spare time on Sunday to put some time into practicing the mock assessment. I redid the Active Record assignment and feel really good about it. I think I made a simple mistake the first time around, but now I know I have it down solid. I&#8217;ll probably review the other few topics sometime this week before the real deal assessment.</p>
